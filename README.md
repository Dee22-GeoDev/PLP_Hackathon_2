How it Works

The platform tackles the challenge of limited educational access in rural areas by offering a digital exam system that works even on low-resource devices.  

- Students can sign up or log in to their accounts.  
- They can then generate an exam, attempt multiple-choice questions, and view their results instantly.  
- A free version is available to ensure inclusivity. For sustainability, the project introduces two subscription tiers:  
  - Basic: 10 Ksh/month – Unlocks additional exam attempts.  
  - Premium: 100 Ksh/month – Provides unlimited access and advanced analytics.  

By combining accessibility with sustainability, the platform ensures that learners in rural areas can practice exams at minimal cost while still supporting ongoing development.
