Project: Online Exam Platform – PLP Hackathon 2
In this project, we built:

A lightweight, accessible online exam platform designed to help learners in rural environments access digital exams.
The system generates quizzes, allows students to attempt them, and provides instant scores. It also features login/signup functionality, a free tier, and a subscription model for sustainability.

🎯 Problem & Solution

Challenge: Limited access to educational resources and exam preparation tools in rural areas.

Solution:

A digital exam system optimized for low-resource devices.

Students can sign up / log in, generate an exam, attempt multiple-choice questions, and view results instantly.

Inclusivity: A free version ensures access for all learners.

Sustainability: Two subscription models:

Basic (10 Ksh/month): Unlocks additional exam attempts.

Premium (100 Ksh/month): Unlimited access + advanced analytics.

By balancing accessibility with sustainability, the platform empowers rural learners with affordable and effective exam preparation tools.
